# Distributed Files

The framework includes distributed files:

- Alias
    - Alias Plugin for supported Alias version
    - Alias Python API modules
- Toolkit
    - Pre-built [Toolkit Plugin](#toolkit_plugin) bundle
- Python37
    - A minimal [embeddable package](#embed_package) for Python 3.7

The Alias distributed files are maintained by the ShotGrid Automotive Team.

## Toolkit

The pre-built Toolkit Plugin bundle is generated by running scripts for `dev`. See [dev](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-framework-alias/tree/main/dev) for more details.

## Embeddable Python Package

The embeddable Python packages are included to ensure a compatible version of Python (and Qt) are available to run the framework with Alias.

For example, Alias 2024.0 uses Qt version 5.15.0, which means the framework must use the matching version of PySide2 5.15.0. PySide 5.15.0 requires Python version < 3.9, so in the event that the user is running with Python >= 3.9, the framework will install the embeddable Python 3.7 package to the user's local `%APPDATA%` folder, and use that version of Python with the framework (instead of the version of Python currently running).

### How to create an embeddable package

1. Download the base embeddable package for the desired Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/).
2. After downloading, unzip the package.
3. Add pip to the python package by running:

```
dist/Python37/python-3.7-embed-amd64/python.exe dev/get-pip.py
```

This will add the `Lib` and `Scripts` folder to the base package.

4. Edit the file `python{major_version}{minor_version}._pth` to uncomment the `import site` line, such that the file content appears as:

```
python37.zip
.

# Uncomment to run site.main() automatically
import site
```

This allows python to find and execute pip:
```
dist/Python37/python-3.7-embed-amd64/python.exe -m pip
```

5. Add a `requirements.txt` to `dist/Python37/Lib` containing the required packages to be installed:

```
eventlet
PySide2==5.15.0
python-socketio
websocket-client
requests
```

6. Zip up the package again. Make sure that when unzipping the package, the `python.exe` file is i the root folder (e.g. make sure an intermediate folder is not added on zip).

At run time, the framework's start up utils will check if the current version of Python is compatible with the framework. If it is not, the framework will install the embeddable package to the user's `%APPDATA%` folder by unzipping `python-3.7-embed-amd64.zip` to `%APPDATA%/Autodesk/Alias/ShotGrid/Python/Python37/install`. The additional packages will be installed using pip and the requiements.txt to `Lib/site-packages`. Regardless of which version of Python is being used, these installed site-packages will be imported by the framework [here](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-framework-alias/blob/main/python/tk_framework_alias/__init__.py), to ensure the correct package versions are used.

If the embeddable package needs to be updated, for example, to add more site-packages, remember to update the `embed_version.txt` file to bump the version. This version is checked to see if the installed embedded package needs to be updated on the user's local disk.
